## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there is a major issue with the [markdown-safe-link](https://github.com/markbattistella/markdown-safe-link) module please shoot me a tweet on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/markbattistella) that you need to discuss a security concern. The action itself doesn't do much more than handle that module.
